            <h2>Redesigning a business website</h2>
            <p>
              The last theme of the semester was also the first group project.
              With an introduction to KEA's library, where one can borrow all
              sorts of equipment, and a walkthrough of Adobe Premier, we were to
              combine our previous learning for the semester's largest project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our task was to select a company to develop and redesign their
              existing website. We chose a small sandwich deli named BAK
              SANDWICH.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            We began by examining the current website and the business concept
            of the company to identify any potential shortcomings. We created a
            sitemap and conducted a BERT test on our fellow students to gather
            their immediate impressions of the website.

          <h2>Moodboards and Style Tile</h2>
          <p>
            As in previous projects, we created mood boards, this time keeping
            the client's wishes in mind (the owner of BAK). This was followed by
            a wireframe, which served as the foundation for building our
            prototype.

          <h2>Coding</h2>
          <p>
            This piece of code has been a crucial element in the construction of
            our website, serving as the foundation for manipulating the height
            of our web pages. This manipulation allows us to create various
            heights, displaying content either as a full page or as a smaller
            box containing information..

          <h2>Video and Editing</h2>
          <p>
            As part of the new design, we shot a mood video of a typical day in
            the business. For preparation, we created a storyboard to make the
            recording process more manageable and efficient. The post-production
            of the footage was edited in Premiere Pro, where we utilized various
            editing techniques, including clip-in-motion.
